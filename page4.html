            I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
            I threw the day-old tea from the cup
            Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
            Memories of a life that's been loved
            Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
            Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
            Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
            But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink
            Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
            A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved
            So, I'll sing Hallelujah
            You were an angel in the shape of my mum
            When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
            Spread your wings as you go
            And when God takes you back
            He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"
            I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
            Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
            John said he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
            And wiped a tear from the side of my face
            And I hope that I see the world as you did, 'cause I know
            A life with love is a life that's been lived
            So, I'll sing Hallelujah
            You were an angel in the shape of my mum
            When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
            Spread your wings as you go
            And when God takes you back
            He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"
            Hallelujah
            You were an angel in the shape of my mum
            You got to see the person I have become
            Spread your wings and I know
            That when God took you back
            He said, "Hallelujah, you're home"

                <h2>Exercise Reflection</h2>
                <p> In this activity, I learned that multimedia elements can make a web page more engaging, interactive and imformative. In this exercise I really find interesting beacuse as a newbie in web design course its really amazing for that there this kind of course that i thought never exist. I always feel amazed by the code/tags of HTML. Also by doing this we enhance our knowledge in the new technology and we can adapt the changes of new technology that can help us in the future.</p>
