                <h1>EFFECT OF THE APPLICATION OF DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ORGANIC FERTILIZER TO THE GROWTH AND YIELD OF CHINESE CABBAGE</h1>
                <hr> 
        
                <h2> CHAPTER 1</h2>
                <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
            
        
                <h4> Nature and Importance of the study</h4>
                Chinese cabbage (Brassica pekinensi) was one of the impottant and most common leafy vegetable sold in the market. It can be growth either for commercial or small scale farming. It resembles the head lettuce in many ways.The leave is soft, thin, light green, broad to oblong and usually wrinkled. It forms a head that was less compact than the cabbage. The leaves may be sort, stout, tall and cylindrical in shape depending on the varities. Asian
                farmers prefer to raise chinese cabbage because of its rapid growth.

            <p> 
                Chinese cabbage has higher vitamin C content than citrus and it is rich with minerals. The crop also contain 2.03% of protein, 0.28% fat, 4.13% carbohydrates and 271 calories per kilo of food (Elayda, 1935). Generally, Chinese
                cabbage grows well in medium to heavy soils. However, higher yield was obtained when planted in friable and fertile soil. Application of feltilizer either organic or inorganic in forms generally improved growth of plants thus, promote
                higher yield. Hence organic feltilizer application improved soil feltility that cause the plant to be productive on the specific crop that were growing on the area. When combine organic or inorganic feltilizer was it common pratice by 
                many vegetable growers. 
            </p>

            <p> 
                In Southeast Asia, chinse cabbage was grown mostly during the cool season or in highlands due to its sensitivity to high temperature and moisture. With the development of heat-tolerant cultivation was expecxted to increase in the
                lowlands during summer season. In some places of the Visayas Region like Region VII, chinese cabbage was successfully grown in commercial scale, particularly in Southeast Cebu (Ramos,1993). Provinces like Baguio, Mt Provice, and Nueva
                Viscaya were leadingf cabbage producing provinces in the Philippines. 
            </p>

            <p> 
                Under Calbayog condition on study has been conducted on the effect of different levels of organic feltilizer on chinese cabbage, hence this study was being proposed.
            </p>

        
            <h2>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</h2>

                This study was conducted specially to:  
            <p>    
                1. Evaluate the growth and yield performance of chinese cabbage by the different levels of organic ferltilizer.
            <p>
                2. Determine the optimum levels of organic feltilizer that gave a higher yield of chinesse cabbage at local condition.
            <p> 
                3. Determine the economic importance of growing chinese cabbage. 

            <h2>SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF THE STUDY</h2>

                This study was focused on the effect of the application of different levels of organic feltilizer, specially chicken dung to chinrse cabbage. This study was conducted in Barangay Alibaba, Calbayog City.

            <h2>TIME AND PLACE OF THE STUDY</h2>
            
            <p>
                 This study was conducted in Barangay Alibaba, Calbayog City from March 1, 2002 to April 30, 2002.
